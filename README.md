## _Navigation Challenge for Candidates Rbrgs 22_


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

Navigation pathfollower application with a goal selector visual feature,
powered with ROS Noetic and the ROS Navigation Stack.

Video demonstration: https://youtu.be/m2oyLRKSaFA

## Features

- PGM file generated through SLAM and optimized for different robot types
- Visual selector of the desired navigation goals thorugh the RViz interface
- Gazebo simulator application to follow the desired number of goals
- Navigation Stack features with  the Turtlebot3

## Tech used
- ROS Noetiic
- Ubuntu 20.04
- Gazebo
- RViz
- ROS Navigation Stack
- Turtlebot3
- GIMP
- Visual Studio Code
- Passion and dedication

## Installation

Package build in ROS Noetic for Ubuntu 20.04

Inside the local `catkin_ws` workspace clone this repository.

```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/afr2903/navigation_challenge.git
$ catkin_make
```
### _Turtlebot3 installation_ 
In case Turtlebot3 is not already installed:
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
$ git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_msgs.git -b noetic-devel
$ git clone  https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3.git -b noetic-devel
$ cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make
```
Then, install the simulation packages needes for the Turtlebot3, with the Gazeebo and RViz tools:
```
~/catkin_ws/src/
$ git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations.git
$ cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make
```
To avoid typing aliases and path lines in everey execution, modify the `./bashrc` file:
```
$ cd
$ gedit .bashrc
```
Inside the bashrc file, put the following aliases. 
```
alias burger='export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger'
alias waffle='export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle'
alias tb3fake='roslaunch turtlebot3_fake turtlebot3_fake.launch'
alias tb3teleop='roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch'
alias tb3='roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_empty_world.launch'
alias tb3maze='roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch'
alias tb3house='roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_house.launch'
```
Also, at the end of the file, write the following commands
```
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
source /home/{user}/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
export SVGA_VGPU10=0
```
### _Move files location under "files" folder_
In order to use the custom launch files and maps, they need to be moved into different locations.
Go to the location of the package: `~/catkin_ws/src/navigation_challenge/files/`:

- Move `roborregos_navigation_challenge.world` to the:
`~/catkin_ws/src/turtlebot3_simulations/turtle3_gazebo/worlds/` folder.

- Move `turtlebot3_roborregos_nav.launch` to the:
`~/catkin_ws/src/turtlebot3_simulations/turtle3_gazebo/launch/` folder.

Now the package is ready to be executed.
## Execution

Run all the applications needed with the following commands.
```
$ roscore
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_roborregos_nav.launch
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_navigation turtlebot3_navigation.launch map_file:=/home/{user}/catkin_ws/src/navigation_challenge/files/navigation_challenge_map.yaml
```
It will open the Gazebo simulator and the RViz Navigation Stack map.
In the RViz window, click on `2D Pose Estimate` and pose the robot in the same Pose as the Gazebo simulator
Open the script `navigation_goal_selector.cpp` and `navigation_pathfollower.cpp`, then change the field `{user}` for your device username, in lines 50 and 25, respectively. Save the changes.

Now build the changes, clear the costmaps and run the `navigation_goal_selector` script:
```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make
$ rosservice call /move_base/clear_costmaps
$ rosrun navigation_challenge goal_selector
```
In the RViz window, click on `2D Pose Estimate` and pose the robot to set a new `Goal`.
The terminal running the script will display a menu:
```
Press an action key:
-[N] Next point
-[R] Repeat point
-[D] Done
-
```
Type the key designated for the desired action then add another `Goal` and repeat.
Or keep adding `Goals` in RViz without typing in the terminal each time, until the end of path, the buffer size is big enough. Just remember the number of `Goals` added.
You can add as many `Goals` as you want.
After pressing the key `D` at the end of your path, you will be prompted with:
```
Type the name for this path:
-
```
After writing the name for your path and pressing `Enter` your path will have been saved in a _.txt_ file

For the `pathfollower` to perform correctly, reset the enviroment by posing the robot in the same Pose as the Gazebo simulator, and clearing the costmaps. Now you can run the `navigation_pathfollower` script.
```
$ rosservice call /move_base/clear_costmaps
$ rosrun navigation_challenge pathfollower
```
In the message display in the terminal, write the name of the desired path to run, exactly as how was saved in the `goal_selector`.
```
Type the name of the path you want to open:
-
```
Now you can enjoy watching the robot following your path ;)

Here is the video demonstration of the whole project process: https://youtu.be/m2oyLRKSaFA

Try adding obstacles during the runtime to witness the ROSNavigation Stack robustness and adaptability.

Any feedback is appreciated <3
